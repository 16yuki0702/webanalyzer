■ building/deploying
・To build or deploy this application, you must install docker first.
  the application can be build by below command.

  docker-compose up

  if you want to run this appliction not only localhost
  but also other environment,
  you can modify environment file `app.env`.
  application host name depends on environment value
  `ANALYZER_WEBSOCKET_HOST` written in this file.
  defaule value is `localhost:8080`.

■ Suggestions on possible improvements of the application
・It has not contain any tests, so tests is needed to more enhance
  application quality. 
・It uses docker. if you feel this application slow,
  you can modify docker settings.
  (for example, increase cpu core number or memory size and so on)
・It uses websocket to improve experience of speed.
  (I wanted to render a item processed in real time)
  so if you use this application in load balancer,
  you should consider how to scale websocket.
・It has not contain any css. so css is needed 
  to make application better appearance.
・Each items are not rendered in certain order,
  so to make it better appearance these should are rendered
  in certain order.
・Fetching each items are sometimes not correct.
  (especially when fetching internal, external links and login form I think)
  these should are more improved.
